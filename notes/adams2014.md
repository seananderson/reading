- "ecosystem service approach is not itself a conservation measure"

- valuation will not always favour conservation

- "conservation is a political choice", ecosystem services are only one of many
  possible arguments for conservation

- with ecosystem services --- the total or mean isn't the only thing that's
  important --- also the unevenness of who gets them [e.g. @halpern2011]
