  abstract	= {<p>Reconstructing the dynamics of populations is
		  complicated by the different types of stochasticity
		  experienced by populations, in particular if some forms of
		  stochasticity introduce bias in parameter estimation in
		  addition to error. Identification of systematic biases is
		  critical when determining whether the intrinsic dynamics of
		  populations are stable or unstable and whether or not
		  populations exhibit an Allee effect, i.e., a minimum size
		  below which deterministic extinction should follow. Using a
		  simulation model that allows for Allee effects and a range
		  of intrinsic dynamics, we investigated how three types of
		  stochasticity---demographic, environmental, and random
		  catastrophes--- affect our ability to reconstruct the
		  intrinsic dynamics of populations. Demographic
		  stochasticity aside, which is only problematic in small
		  populations, we find that environmental
		  stochasticity---positive and negative environmental
		  fluctuations---caused increased error in parameter
		  estimation, but bias was rarely problematic, except at the
		  highest levels of noise. Random catastrophes, events
		  causing large-scale mortality and likely to be more common
		  than usually recognized, caused immediate bias in parameter
		  estimates, in particular when Allee effects were large. In
		  the latter case, population stability was predicted when
		  endogenous dynamics were actually unstable and the minimum
		  viable population size was overestimated in populations
		  with small or non-existent Allee effects. Catastrophes also
		  generally increased extinction risk, in particular when
		  endogenous Allee effects were large. We propose a method
		  for identifying data points likely resulting from
		  catastrophic events when such events have not been
		  recorded. Using social spider colonies (<italic>Anelosimus
		  spp.</italic>) as models for populations, we show that
		  after known or suspected catastrophes are accounted for,
		  reconstructed growth parameters are consistent with
		  intrinsic dynamical instability and substantial Allee
		  effects. Our results are applicable to metapopulation or
		  time series data and are relevant for predicting extinction
		  in conservation applications or the management of invasive
		  species.</p>},
